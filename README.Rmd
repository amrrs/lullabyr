Children's songs can be repetitive. This is said to be good for 
childrens' learning, but can get boring for parents. This package helps 
parents who lack creativity (or energy) to generate childrens' songs with 
new words in them. It's also a great way to get your child (if they're old 
enough) to generate a song for themselves. Maybe they'll get inspired and 
want to learn R!

## Installation

This package is not on CRAN. You can install it from GitHub with:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("mine-cetinkaya-rundel/lullabyr")
```

## Example

Start by loading the package.

```{r}
library(lullabyr)
```

Let's set a seed for the random generation first.

```{r}
set.seed(52)
```

A is for... with animals:

```{r}
sing_alphabet(animals)
```

A is for... with vegetables:

```{r}
sing_alphabet(vegetables)
```

A is for... with fruits:

```{r}
sing_alphabet(fruits)
```

A is for... with countries. There are no recognized countries starting with 
some of the letters so we get a warning:

```{r}
sing_alphabet(countries)
```

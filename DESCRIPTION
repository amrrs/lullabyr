Title: Generate children's songs with random words
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel

Description: Children's songs can be repetitive. This is said to be good for 
    childrens' learning, but can get boring for parents. This package helps 
    parents who lack creativity (or energy) to generate childrens' songs with 
    new words in them. It's also a great way to get your child (if they're old 
    enough) to generate a song for themselves. Maybe they'll get inspired and 
    want to learn R!
